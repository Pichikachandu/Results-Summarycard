## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Throughout this project, I learned about:

- How to effectively use CSS Grid and Flexbox to create responsive layouts.
- Implementing hover and focus states for interactive elements to enhance user experience.
- Utilizing React's state management to dynamically populate data from a local JSON file.
  
For example, I implemented a hover effect on buttons using CSS:

```css
button:hover {
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I aim to:

- Explore advanced CSS techniques for animations and transitions.
- Deepen my understanding of React's hooks and context API for state management.
- Experiment with TypeScript in React applications for better type safety.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - This resource helped me understand Flexbox better and provided various layout examples.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - A comprehensive guide that was useful for understanding semantic HTML and CSS properties.
